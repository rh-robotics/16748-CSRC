     * Constructor for RobotComponents
     *
     * @param motor              Motor Declaration
     * @param ticks_per_rotation Value of ticks for specific motor RPM. Can be found on the manufacture's website (GoBuilda, Rev, etc)
     * @param p                  The Proportional Value tuned after F (if applicable) until the motor can barely get to its target position. Typically under 0.1, but may be higher.
     * @param i                  The Integral Value tuned last, only if steady state error continues. Typically relatively unnecessary unless extreme precision is needed and typically of a value in the tenths of decimals. Be sure to re-tune D afterwards.
     * @param d                  The Derivative Value tuned after P, this value helps reduce oscillation in reaching a target and should result in a smoothed out curve when going to a target. Extremely small and sensitive, typically around 0.001. Re-tune after adjusting I.
     * @param f                  The Feed-forward value, tuned before anything else by increasing until the motor can hold itself against gravity at any position. Only use if you want a motor to hold its position against gravity and never use on locking systems like worm gears (in this case, set to 0)! Value is variable based on necessary motor power, but should be low (under 0.1) to avoid motor overheating and power draw.
